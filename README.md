## Hammer Unit Converter 

This tool I have made for personal using when I worked on CS:GO map based by real location (You can see this map in workshop https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=857973374)

With this tool you can easily convert dimensions from Hammer SDK Unit to Cm, M, Inches, Feet and vice versa.
I don't know if this tool will be useful for someone but if it will - I surelly be happy.
